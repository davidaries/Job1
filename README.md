# Job1
Initial job for managing employees
In current state:
The application has three windows
  1. The main window to control pause, unpause, and end program commands
  2. A running timer in format of Hours:Minutes:Seconds
  3. A layout for the log with 
      Worker name  |    Event  |  time
      
      
I have also left in a function for getting the current internal time of the system (if it could be necessary in the future) but that can be deleted if you request
